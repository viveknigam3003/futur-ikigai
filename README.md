## What is this tool? 🤔

> Ikigai (生き甲斐, "a reason for being") is a Japanese concept referring to having a direction or purpose in life, providing a sense of fulfillment to a person, and towards which they may take actions, giving them satisfaction and a sense of meaning.

In December 2020, [The Futur](https://thefutur.com/), streamed a workshop on their Youtube channel which helps you generate business ideas for your _Ikigai_.

The video: **[Ikigai Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAzs3amtEFA) – Build A Business That Combines What You're Good At, Love, & The World Needs.**

The regular workshop would require you to have - 3x5" index cards (3 colors) or have a sheet of paper folded into 3 columns, 6 sided die x 2 (one will do), and a sharpie pen. Instead you can use this tool if you want to and keep yourself undistracted from that amazing workshop.
 
Follow the video along with this tool to generate business ideas that combine the things you love, things you're good at, and what the world needs!
## How to use this tool? 📖

### STEP 1: Looking Inside. 

This step is about discovering yourself and finding out what you **love**, what you're **good at**, and what the **world needs**. Keep on filling the lists by typing in and pressing Enter to save.

__To Edit__ - Click on the item you wish to edit and enter edit mode by selecting the first option (looks like a pen).

__To Delete__ - Click/Tap the item and select the Delete button (in red).

Try to fill in __atleast 12 items__ in each list. Click on the _i_ icon to get some hints. Once done with this step. Move on to Step 2

### Step 2: Finding Ikigai.

This is where we will generate you a random combination by selecting one thing from the list of things you love, one from things you're good at, and one which the world needs. Select the idea generated and proceed towards using your creativity to come up with ideas.

Write down one idea each for a __Tangible Item__, __A digital product__, and a __service-based__ business for your combination.

You can also name the particular combination by clicking/tapping on "Untitiled" and then renaming it to whatever you like.

## Where is my data stored? 📦

We do NOT collect any personal data from you, and all your data is stored on your particular device. But this means that your lists and ideas are not synced across your devices (laptop, mobile, and tablet).

We just collect some anonymous analytics data to understand the performance of the application.
